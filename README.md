# 42_Cursus_Project 
# Project name : Webserv 

## Description(Preambule):

<This project is about writing my own HTTP server.
HTTP is one of the most used protocols on the internet.
Knowing its arcane will be useful, even if you won’t be working on a website/>

- The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed,
collaborative, hypermedia information systems.
- HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access.
- For example, by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.
HTTP was developed to facilitate hypertext and the World Wide Web.
The primary function of a web server is to store, process, and deliver web pages to
clients. The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
- Pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents, which may include images,
style sheets, and scripts in addition to the text content.
Multiple web servers may be used for a high-traffic website.
- A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by
requesting a specific resource using HTTP and the server responds with the content of
that resource or an error message if unable to do so. The resource is typically a real file
on the server’s secondary storage, but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how
the webserver is implemented.
- While the primary function is to serve content, full implementation of HTTP also
includes ways of receiving content from clients. This feature is used for submitting web
forms, including the uploading of files.

## Todo List:
    - clean all the code and make it more readable.
    - make it more efficient. ( networking, CGI(php, python), Upload, session and cokiees ...) 
    - make it more secure. (Config file, ...)
    - ...

## Installation:
-  ....

## Usage:
-   ./webserv [configuration_file]
